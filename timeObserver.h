/*
timeObserver.h

Plane object header file

timeObserver - What every object who needs to be updated by the clock needs to 
inherit publicly. It has a basic onTimeUpdate method which will be overridden
to allow each object to perform its own action when it is called. Additionally,
it has a Is_done variable for error catching, that only is set to true after
all steps in the on timeUpdate are completed.

Who makes this object? timeManager

Is it a time observer? Yes (duh)

Whatâ€™s its goal? Be able to receive updates from timeManager, and perform and action everytime it gets one
